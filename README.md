Compute the associated graded algebra and Schur functors to obtain an equivariant basis for Buchsbaum-Eisenbud varieties of complexes
---
This will compute the associated graded algebra in terms of Schur functors of a Buchsbaum-Eisenbud variety of complexes
in order to obtain an equivariant basis for the varieties. This equivariance can be used in the construction of 
equivariant neural networks compatable with current methods for constructing group rquivariant neural networks. The performance
of this new method (as a possible additional set of features) is untested, but it is hoped to improve accuracy and efficency. 
This may also prove useful in a geometric complexity theory context related to the [Honeycomb Model of GL(n)](https://github.com/The-Singularity-Research/Schur-Shor). See [Macaulay2](http://www2.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/doc/Macaulay2-1.17/share/doc/Macaulay2/MonomialAlgebras/html/index.html), 
the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.3653) and the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0774) for an explanation of how the structure sheaf for
representation schemes of surface algebras can be regarded as a semigroup ring with standard monomial theory and how they can be decomposed
into associated graded algebras by Schur functors.
